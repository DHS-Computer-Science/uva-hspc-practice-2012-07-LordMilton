# Practice 2012 - 08: Back and Forth

## Background
The neighborhood kids have come up with another crazy game. Everybody
runs back and forth within bounds, but they can only move in straight
lines! The rules of the game are as follows:
- Before the game starts, someone is chosen to be “it.”
- The game goes for a set amount of rounds, during which each player may take
  one step in their given direction.
- If more than two players land on a spot at one time, they all reverse their
  direction.
- If only two collide, then they will switch directions for the next step as
  follows. The one with the longer name starts moving in the direction that the
  other would. The one with the shorter name takes the reverse of the direction
  of the other player. (This only works because all of the kids in the
  neighborhood have different length names.)
- If a player’s next step would put the player out of bounds, they reverse
  direction before taking their step.
- The winner is the person who ends up closest to the “it” player, with ties
  going to the person with the shorter name.
John thinks that this game is silly, since he could predict the outcome just by
knowing the initial configuration. He wants you to write a program to do just
that so he can show the other kids and convince them to play better games. Below
is the representation of the first test case. Note that (0,0) is the bottom-left
corner.

## Description

### Input
The first line of input is the number of test cases that follow. Each test case
begins with a line containing integers M , N , and P : the field’s width, its
height (both measured in “steps”), and the number of players, respectively
(M, N, P < 10). The next P lines contain space-separated values, starting with
the name of one kid, followed by the x and y coordinates of their starting
position on the field and the direction in which they start (N , S, E, or W ).
No two kids will start in the same spot. The first of the kids listed is “it”
for the game. The last line of the test case (≤ 1000) is the number of rounds
to play.

### Output
Read the sample output, it's pretty obvious.
